# Livekit-Speech-to-speech-Model
This project presents a real-time multi-user speech communication system using the LiveKit framework, integrating Speech-to-Text (STT), AI processing (LLM), and Text-to-Speech (TTS) in a shared virtual room. It enables multiple participants to interact with an AI agent simultaneously through a simple room key.
